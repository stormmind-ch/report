== Influencing Factors<weather-research>

The causes mentioned in this section are neither exhaustive nor account for all damages listed in @dmg_xl. In a conversation with Liechti #footnote[Dr. Käthi Liechti, Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin Gebirgshydrologie und Massenbewegung
Hydrologische Vorhersagen, Eidg. Forschungsanstalt WSL], several contributing factors were discussed, of which only a subset were considered in the model. The influencing factors discussed were:

*Topological gradients*: The question addressed was whether known threshold values of slope (in percent or degrees) exist to differentiate between low, intermediate, and high landslide risk. However, no definitive or commonly accepted values could be established. Given the timeframe of the thesis project, limited further research could not provide any conclusive information.\

*Forest/Deforestation*: Deforestation is widely recognized as a contributing factor to landslides, primarily due to the loss of root systems that stabilize the soil @Erdrutsch2025.  Liechti confirmed this statement but also pointed out that forests themselves possess considerable weight, which may also contribute to slope instability. Applying this insight would require additional data and investigation.

*Soil condition*: This factor is discussed in detail within subsection where applicable.\

*Frozen ground*: Frozen soil exhibits increased cohesive strength, which helps prevent landslides.\

*Rainfall*: Closely linked to soil conditions and therefore specifically addressed in each subsection.\

*Snowfall*: Snowfall itself does not directly cause the damages under investigation but builds the source for later snowmelt.\

*Snowmelt*: Significantly contributes to the total volume of water input and has effects comparable to rainfall.\

*Small animals and soil organisms*: This topic lies outside the scope of Liechti's expertise and was excluded from further consideration due to limited time.\

=== Reasons for Flooding

Flooding is primarily mitigated by the soil's capacity to absorb water. The composition of the topsoil is the most relevant factor: a non-permeable surface—such as rock or compacted clay—prevents infiltration, resulting in all incoming water contributing to surface runoff. In contrast, permeable materials such as sand or loose soil can absorb substantial amounts of water, depending on the depth of the soil layer (as detailed in @rfls).  
Even permeable ground can temporarily become impermeable during early spring when frozen. Conversely, drought has a similar effect: extended periods of high temperature and absent precipitation dry out the surface layer of the soil, thereby reducing or even eliminating its ability to absorb water. The behavior of completely dry soil is comparable to that of any other non-permeable material.  
All of these mechanisms are governed by the total water input, which originates either from rainfall, melting snow, or soil conditions. @liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025

Prolonged precipitation continuously supplies water to the soil. If the ground is permeable and allows both infiltration and subsurface drainage, the overall impact remains limited. However, when the absorbed water cannot drain away, saturation occurs. Once the soil reaches full capacity, it effectively becomes impermeable—regardless of its natural permeability—and behaves like rock or clay, leading to increased surface runoff.  
In addition, sudden and sustained temperature increases—often cause significant snowmelt—can further augment the water load on the soil surface alongside rainfall.

=== Reasons for Landslide<rfls>

/*Of the potential causes for landslides, three were selected for consideration, as they were highlighted by Liechti @liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025 as the most relevant and easily identifiable, without requiring in-depth geological analysis. The first—loose gravel or rock—is not directly influenced by current weather conditions and was therefore excluded. /*The second reason relates to water infiltrating small cracks in bedrock, where it freezes and expands at sub-zero temperatures, causing the rock to fracture (Hauptprozess: *Sturz*).  gem. kätthi grund für sturz meisst unbekannt*/
The second and relevant factor is the water absorption capacity of loose soil (e.g., dirt). As water is absorbed, the soil mass increases in weight—from dry ($0.83 k g \/ d m^3$ @mariaGewichtNasserErde2020) to wet ($1.6 - 1.76 k g \/ d m^3$ @designerpartSchuettgutGewichtBigBag). This gain in mass reduces the soil's ability to remain stable.  
Third, subsurface clay layers limit water infiltration on the one hand, but on the other hand, they promote landslides by forming smooth and slippery interfaces between different soil types and by preventing subsurface drainage.  
In contrast, a jagged and solid rock surface also impedes subsurface drainage but may reduce landslide risk by mechanically anchoring the overlying soil layer.
