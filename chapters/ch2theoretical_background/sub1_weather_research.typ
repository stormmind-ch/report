The causes mentioned in this section are neither exhaustive nor account for all damages listed in @dmg_xl. In a conversation with K. Liechti (@liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025), several contributing factors were discussed, of which only a subset were considered in the model. The discussed influencing factors were:\

*Topological gradients*: The question addressed was whether known threshold values of slope (in percent or degrees) exist to differentiate between low, intermediate, and high landslide risk. Unfortunately, the answer was negative. Due to time constraints during the thesis project, further research — e.g., literature reviews — could not provide any conclusive information.\

*Forest/Deforestation*: According to Wikipedia (@Erdrutsch2025), deforestation contributes to landslides by eliminating trees, thereby destroying the stabilizing effect of their roots. K. Liechti confirmed this statement but also pointed out that forests themselves possess considerable weight, which may also contribute to slope instability. Applying this insight would require additional data and investigation, and was therefore deprioritized due to time limitations.\

*Soil condition*: This factor is discussed in detail within each relevant subsection.\

*Ground frost*: Frozen soil exhibits increased cohesive strength, which helps prevent landslides.\

*Rainfall*: Closely linked to soil conditions; specifically addressed in each subsection.\

*Snowfall*: Snowfall itself does not directly cause the damages under investigation but serves as a source for later snowmelt.\

*Snowmelt*: Significantly contributes to the total volume of water input and has effects comparable to rainfall.\

*Small animals and soil organisms*: This topic lies outside the scope of K. Liechti's expertise and was excluded from further consideration due to limited time.\

=== Reason for Flooding

Flooding is primarily mitigated by the soil's capacity to absorb water. The composition of the topsoil is the most relevant factor: a non-permeable surface, such as rock or compacted clay, prevents infiltration, resulting in all water being converted to surface runoff. In contrast, permeable materials such as sand or loose soil can absorb substantial amounts of water, depending on the depth of the soil layer (further details in @rfls). Even permeable ground can temporarily become impermeable during early spring when frozen. All these mechanisms are controlled by the total water input, originating either from rainfall or melting snow @liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025.

Prolonged precipitation continuously supplies water to the soil. If the ground is permeable and enables both infiltration and subsurface drainage, the overall impact remains limited. However, when the absorbed water cannot drain away, saturation occurs. Once the soil reaches full capacity, it effectively becomes impermeable—regardless of its natural permeability—and behaves like rock or clay, leading to increased surface runoff.  
In addition, sudden and sustained temperature increases—often indicative of significant snowmelt—can further augment the water load on the soil surface alongside rainfall @liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025.

=== Reason for Landslide<rfls>

Of the potential causes for landslides, three were considered. The first—loose gravel or rock—is not directly influenced by current weather conditions and was therefore excluded. The second reason relates to water infiltrating small cracks in bedrock, where it freezes and expands at sub-zero temperatures, causing the rock to fracture (Hauptprozess: *Sturz*).  
The third and most relevant factor is the water absorption capacity of loose soil (e.g., dirt). As water is absorbed, the soil mass increases in weight—from dry ($0.83 k g \/ d m^3$ @mariaGewichtNasserErde2020) to wet ($1.6 - 1.76 k g \/ d m^3$ @designerpartSchuettgutGewichtBigBag). This gain in mass reduces the soil's ability to remain stable.  
Additionally, subsurface clay layers limit water infiltration on the one hand, but on the other hand, they promote landslides by forming smooth and slippery interfaces between different soil types and by preventing subsurface drainage.  
In contrast, a jagged and solid rock surface also impedes subsurface drainage but may reduce landslide risk by mechanically anchoring the overlying soil layer @liechtiAustauschUnwetterschaedenUnd2025.
