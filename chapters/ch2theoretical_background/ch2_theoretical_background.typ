= Theoretical Background
This chapter presents the theoretical foundations required to understand the methods and models used in this work. The first part provides an overview of the physical and environmental aspects relevant to the prediction of storm-induced damage, including the meteorological mechanisms behind severe weather events and their typical impact patterns. This domain knowledge is essential for identifying meaningful input features and understanding the context of the prediction task.

The second part introduces the machine learning and deep learning concepts that underpin the modeling approach. It starts with basic #abbr.a[FNN] and progresses toward more advanced architectures tailored for sequential data, such as #abbr.a[RNN], #abbr.a[LSTM], and Transformer models. These architectures form the core of the predictive models developed in this thesis.

By combining insights from both atmospheric science and data-driven modeling, this chapter establishes the conceptual framework for the design and implementation of the storm damage forecasting pipeline.
