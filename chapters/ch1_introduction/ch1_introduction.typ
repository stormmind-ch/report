= Introduction

== Motivation
In a rapidly changing world where ecological awareness is more crucial than ever, the aim is to leverage the latest technologies to contribute positively to the environment. While many people use generative AI for entertainment or convenience—such as creating humorous images or drafting emails—thus indirectly accelerating climate change through increased energy consumption, this thesis seeks to utilize artificial intelligence to serve a more meaningful purpose: to detect and warn about emerging threats and damages caused by environmental and climatic changes. 



== Work Outline
The objective of this project is to establish a baseline and explore initial steps toward predicting or forecasting environmental damage. As outlined throughout this thesis, numerous geological processes and a range of influencing factors would typically require in-depth expertise in geology—areas that were deliberately excluded to keep the scope at a foundational level. Instead, the focus was placed on weather data as a key influencing factor, while the primary data source for recorded damages consisted of reports published in regional and local newspapers. Various deep learning approaches, differing in complexity and methodology, were applied to assess how weather data may offer initial insights and help identify which predictive strategies warrant further exploration in future research.
