= Methodology
This chapter outlines the methodological approach used to design, implement, and evaluate the system developed in this project. It is divided into three main sections. First, we describe the data sources, preprocessing steps, and preparation techniques applied to support the deep learning experiments. Next, we present the architecture and implementation details of the deep learning models. Finally, we discuss the software engineering aspects of the project, including the design of the backend and frontend components, as well as the implementation of a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
