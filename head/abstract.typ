Storms have caused over 11.2 billion Swiss francs in damages in Switzerland over the past five decades, yet the true cost may be even higher when considering the psychological toll on affected populations. This thesis explores whether Deep Learning models can forecast such storm-induced damages using only meteorological data. We compare three architectures: #abbr.l[FNN], #abbr.l[LSTM] and Transformer models, across various spatial granularity. To combat class imbalance, we introduced spatial clustering of municipalities and weekly temporal aggregation. Our best-performing model, a Transformer trained on six spatial clusters, achieved an average F1-score of $0.68$ in binary storm damage forecasting. The final system was deployed as a publicly accessible web service (_stormmind.ch_), enabling real-time inference from current weather forecasts. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of AI-driven storm damage forecasting, but also lays the groundwork for more comprehensive models integrating geospatial and infrastructural data in future research.
