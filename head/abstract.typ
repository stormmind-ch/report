= Abstract

Extreme weather events cause considerable damage to infrastructure, the economy and the environment worldwide. Predicting such damage can help to optimize preventive measures and reduce costs. In this project, a neural network is being developed that analyzes historical weather data and damage reports to predict potential storm damage in Switzerland based on new weather forecasts. Using modern machine learning techniques, relevant patterns are recognized in order to train a predictive model. The model is tested for accuracy and optimized to enable reliable predictions.
