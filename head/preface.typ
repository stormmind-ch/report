Growing up in Affoltern am Albis, Switzerland, a locality repeatedly battered by floods, we witnessed natural hazards as more than abstract news items. Water‑logged fields and impassable forest tracks were fixtures of our childhood. These early encounters later converged with an academic fascination for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: could algorithms trained on historical data recognise the event of storm damages?

A search for suitable datasets led us to the Storm Damage Database created by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest Snow and Landscape Research WSL. When the institute gracefully granted access to five decades of geo‑referenced storm‑impact records, the idea of merging lived experience with algorithmic insight crystallised.
